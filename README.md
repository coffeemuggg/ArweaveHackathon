## ⚙️ How we built it

## Forward Research Universal Data License

(Build an open youtube-style platform on Arweave that lets users browse for videos, tip creators, and buy into the revenue streams for content -- all of which can be licensed with the UDL.)

## Best use of Kwil

(There is no explicit mandate for this bounty other than that the submission must use Kwil; teams are encouraged to leverage Kwil in unique ways, whether it be by building an application, tooling, or otherwise.)

(Build a Permaweb app that leverages Othent for authentication and transaction uploading. The integration can be done via ArweaveKit, OthentJS, or through direct interaction with Othent account contracts.)
