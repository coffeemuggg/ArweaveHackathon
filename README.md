# StreamWeave

## 💡 Inspiration

Unlike Patreon, Kickstarter, Kofi, Indiegogo, Onlyfans, Fansly, our platform has permanent storage of videos, no censorship, and content creators don’t need to give a big cut to the subscription platform. We have created a decentralized streaming platform where anyone can come and upload their content.

## 💻 What it does

Our web app StreamWeave is built with the following features:

## ⚙️ How we built it

- Web App: Next Js
- Storage: Arweave
- Database: Kwil
- Authentication: Othent

## 🎥 Forward Research Universal Data License

We have created an open youtube-style platform on Arweave that lets users browse for videos, tip creators, and buy into the revenue streams for the content all of which is licensed with the UDL.

## 📁 Best use of Kwil

We are using Kwil as our primary decentralized database to store uploaded information. Kwil makes it very easy to work with and makes our app much better.
